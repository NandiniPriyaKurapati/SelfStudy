Selenium webdriver is released as a part of selenium 2.0.It is designed in an opitmal 
way for modern web applications.

It is useful for full web automation. Selenium webdriver is the main component in 
selenium automation. It drives the browser natively using native commands(internal commands) 
like an end user which is very robust. Webdriver is a more object oriented when compared to the 
Selenium 1.0 and Selenium RC. You can run with the Web elemnts, windows, dialogs. It still 
supports all the old seleniumm RC code. It supports Multiple operating systems, 
multiple browsers (and versions in it), multiple languages.

Overcomes selenium 1.0 and selenium RC limitations like popps, dialog boxes, file upload, 
download, multiple browsers.

Selenium Rc uses Javascript to drive the browser, which is not acceptable in the 
same way by all the browsers. 

Multiple operating systems: Windows, Linux, Unix, MAc, Solaris.
Multiple browsers: Firefox, chrome, opera, IE, safari.

Technically speaking Selenium WebDriver is an interface and it defines the methods that 
you want to use to drive a browser(Interface is a object oreinted programming language 
concept). When you want close a browser or get url or get some other things, webdriver 
provides the methods for that to acheive the actions. When a class implements an interface 
it implements the methods defined in that interface.

Now firefox is implementing the webdriver interface with findElement(), getTitle(), close(),
getCurrentUrl() methods. It is same methods for all the browsers, but code changes according 
to the.

WebDriver interface- use diffferent implementations for different browsers.
