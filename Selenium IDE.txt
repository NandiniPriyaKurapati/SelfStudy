Selenium identiifes their web elements by looking at their html attributes

Build test case and save the test case in a folder.

Anchor Tag is a hyperlink whcih is used to link form one page to anothe rpage.
You can export any test case using file option- Export Test Case to any language 
of your choice ir available options.
After exporting the test case you can see the file in a folder and open it in a 
notepad or wrod pad then you can see the code in desired langauge and also the webdriver 
language.
You can see the recent test cases in a recent test cases in File menu
You can see the properties of a test case in File menu and change the file name or 
file title.
If you want to insert annew command, you can insert or delete or copy or insert new comment.

In actions Menu you can record, setting breakpoint(Seetiing breakpoint gives the control 
over program execution), set start point.
In options Menu there is options bar in which there will be a encoding type, 
default timed out value(whenever we use click and wait then it will use the time specified 
in the default timed out value.)

Selenium core extensions are user extensions.js, They are mainly the custom commands or 
custom functions.
Selenium IDE extensions (Selenium IDE plugins)are the adding the more fucntionality.
Assert title work as extra for verification.
options--> history and reset Selenium IDE
You can change or rename everything in the Options menu
In selenium Blog you can check the documentation and issues rageding that in HELP menu.
You can pause or resume or run step by step. Apply roleup  rules whcih allows repetitive 
sequence of selenium commands to be grouped in a sinlge action. Mostly used in Advanced 
options or use selenium web driver.

Select is not working in Selenium IDE
Log at the bottom of the page displays the logs (Execution)
Info will show info and if you have errors, then select errors 
Reference will give information that how it works.
Selenium columns and values are case sensitive.
you ARE limited with two arguments


Selenium IDE test case contains command-action, target-web element, value-input data or 
value for the step.
Location strategies- by identifier(Default), id, name, 
Xpath(//input[@id='value' and @placeholder='password']), Xpath Attributes, link, CSS, DOM.
Selenium columns are case sensitve.


//htmltag[@attribute1='value1'and@attribute2='value2']
//input[@id='passwd'and@placeholder='password']
//input[contains(@id,'user')]
//input[starts-with(@name,'pass')] 

Xpath-Relative is used to table cells
//htmltag[@attribute='value']/htmltag/.../htmltag
When you don't have any ids or values to be given in the command or target or value then 
go for Xpath-Relative for table rows and columns. Show selenium all commands and use 
assertText and click on that to get the value.

Xpath-position and Xpath-Absolute is not recomended to use.

Locate the web elements by using the DOM, CSS.

Best reccomendations:
id, name, link if these three are not available then go for Xpath Attributes, 
Xpath Relative for tables.

Using selenium IDE- using location strategies identify the web elements.


Ways to build the test case:
Recording 
Context Menu
