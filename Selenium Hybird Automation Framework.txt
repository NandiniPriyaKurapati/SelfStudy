You can use any class in the page to work with that page.  Here for example My acccount 
page consists of several functionality and each functionality has a class.

We can use page object framework for this, because page object framework is a designpattern 
h ybrid automation framework, which can reduce the code duplication and enhnacing the test
maintanance. Now most selenium experts are reccomending to design your page with page 
objects framework. 

The is a clear sepeartion between test code(test steps and assertions) and 
page specific code(page functionality and locators). When you are building a 
hybrid automation framework, founadtion should be the page object framework. After 
that data driven framework and keyword driven framework. 
Any new test cases must be written in the test case package.

Test using page object framework for my account page:

right click on the package and select TestNG and create TestNG class. Give 
name for that class. Here any test case should inherit from the test base calss.
