We need to add selenium server to the project in eclipse. and there you 
can see many Jar files in referenced libraries. a number of packges are there, they 
represent selenium functionality, selenium APIs, all classes like firefox driver, web driver,
chrome driver. 

code for firefox browser

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

driver .get("http://www.indeed.co.uk");

Thread.sleep(2000);

driver.findElement(By.id("what")).sendKeys("Selenium");

driver.findElement(By.id("where")).clear();


driver.findElement(By.id("where")).sendKeys("London");

driver.findElement(By.id("fj")).click();
There is no need to use clickandwait because we are using the 
webdriver, once the page gets loaded it is going to give us the control back.


System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.id("searchCount")).getText());

driver.close();


IN the exception handling, add throws Interupted exception.

wokrs, architecture, test case and execution.

Web elements are textbox, button, dropdown.
